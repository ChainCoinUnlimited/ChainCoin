\section intro_sec Introduction

This is the developer documentation of the reference client for an experimental new digital currency called Chaincoin,
which enables instant payments to anyone, anywhere in the world. Chaincoin uses peer-to-peer technology to operate
with no central authority: managing transactions and issuing money are carried out collectively by the network.

The software is a community-driven open source project, released under the MIT license.

See https://github.com/chaincoin/chaincoin and https://chaincoin.org/ for further information about the project.
